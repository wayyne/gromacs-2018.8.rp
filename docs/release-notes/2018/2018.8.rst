issues. It also incorporates all fixes made in previous versions,
which you can find described in the :ref:`release-notes`.

Fixes where mdrun could behave incorrectly
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fix incorrect pressure when atoms in CMAP cross a box boundary
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The virial calculation and thus the pressure would be incorrect
when the second and third atom involved in a CHARMM CMAP correction
term would reside in different periodic images. This can happen when
a protein is positioned over a box boundary. Note that the energy
and forces were correct, but sampling was affected when pressure
coupling was applied when a protein crossed a box boundary.
